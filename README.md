Final Semester Project F24

Solving the Duffing Equation 

Here is my Analytical Mechanics Final Project for F24.
All the code and graphs used are from ProjectCode.ipynb
(Just using standard off the shelf ODE solvers)

Python Version Used: Python 3.9.18
See All my dependencies in requirements.txt

NOTE: The duffing Plots directory is gitignored to prevent large volume pushs
